##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

(My answer here)

The html file and JS are like the foundation, walls, stairs, doors, and rooms of a house. CSS is like what each room has within it, each CSS file adding a dash new to each room. The `base.css` file is adding the floor and paint to the rooms as a whole; the `layout.css` adds another few big furniture items, and maybe a different wall color to make some room unique; then, in this case, the last css file is `modules.css` and they add the decorations and other small furnishings that make a room special and unique to itself.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

(My answer here)

I did absolutely no refactoring of the old CSS, there was not a need to do so as long as the order was made clear in the html file.
